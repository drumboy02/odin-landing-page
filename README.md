TOP Project: Landing Page Foundations Course

This is my Landing Page project for The Odin Project to demonstrate CSS and Flexbox skills.
The goal was to match my page as closely as possible to the sample in 01.png.

I replaced the image placeholders in the sample with some images generated by Microsoft's Copilot 
AI for fun.
